## Increasing the Logging

It is possible to set the logging level for various components by setting an `ADDITIONAL_LOGGING` environment variable for the Hawkular Metrics pod.

`ADDITIONAL_LOGGING` takes a comma separated list of the name of the component and the debugging level to be applied.

For instance, to set the logging level of Hawkular Metrics and its alerting component to `DEBUG` you would make the following changes to the `hawkular-metrics` replication controller:

[options="nowrap"]
----
        env:
        - name: ADDITIONAL_LOGGING
          value: org.hawkular.metrics=DEBUG,org.hawkular.alerts=DEBUG
----
