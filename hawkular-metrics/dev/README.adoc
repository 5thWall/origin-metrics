== About
This directory exists in order to support building development images. If `build-images.sh`
is executed with `--dev` and if hawkular-metrics.war exists in this directory, then the
hawkular-metrics image will be built using the local copy of the WAR instead of downloading
a released artifact from the JBoss nexus repo.
